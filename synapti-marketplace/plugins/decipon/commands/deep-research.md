# Deep Research: $ARGUMENTS

Conduct comprehensive research using Time-Tested Diffusion (TTD) methodology.

## Step 1: Research Brief

Create a structured brief:
```
RESEARCH BRIEF
Topic: [derived from request]
Key Questions:
1. [Primary]
2. [Secondary]
3. [Tertiary]
Constraints: [limits]
```

## Step 2: Initial Draft

Write from existing knowledge. Mark uncertainty:
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` - unsure claims
- `[RESEARCH NEEDED]` - gaps
- `[CONFIDENCE: LOW/MED/HIGH]`

## Step 3: Red Team Critique

Attack your draft for:
- Logical fallacies (circular reasoning, false dichotomies)
- Evidence gaps (unsourced, single-source)
- Coverage gaps (missing perspectives)

Rate each issue 1-10 severity.

## Step 4: Research with Reflection

**CRITICAL: After EVERY search, reflect:**
```
REFLECTION:
- Key facts: [with confidence 1-100]
- Gaps remaining: [what's missing]
- Source agreement: [contradictions?]
- Decision: [search again / move on / done]
```

## Step 5: Source Tracking

Track every fact:
```
FACT: [Statement]
SOURCE: [URL]
CONFIDENCE: [1-100]
DISPUTED: [Yes/No]
```

## Step 6: Quality Evaluation

Score after each cycle:
- Comprehensiveness (1-10)
- Accuracy (1-10)

```
QUALITY LOG:
Iteration 1: Comp [X], Acc [Y], Avg [Z]
```

If average < 7: repeat critique → research → refine (max 3 cycles)

## Step 7: Final Report

```markdown
# [Title]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraphs]

## Findings
[with inline citations]

## Methodology
[sources, confidence approach]

## Limitations
[gaps, disputes]

## Sources
[numbered with confidence]
```
