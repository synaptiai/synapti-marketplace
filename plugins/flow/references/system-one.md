# System One (optional)

Flow makes many narrow judgments whose answer comes from a closed set. Examples: whether two review findings describe the same defect, whether a comment still applies, whether a user turn is a correction. A System One model answers that kind of question directly. It takes a **state** (text or JSON) and typed **questions**, and returns calibrated probabilities:

| Type | Answers | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `noul` | the probability that a statement is true | "The cited code does what the finding claims." |
| `choice` | one option from a set you define, with a probability for each | "Which consolidated finding reports the same defect, or none?" |
| `score` | a position on 2 to 10 ordered levels | "How urgent is this ticket?" |

It does not generate text or use tools.

Flow can use one when you configure a provider. With no provider, the default, Flow behaves exactly as it does without this feature.

## Status

The client is in place. **No decision point uses it yet.** Each one is added, with its questions and thresholds, by the change that wires it in, and ships in `shadow` mode until a measurement supports switching it on.

## Decision points

| Site | Where | What it asks | Default | Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `classify.serves-issue` | `/flow:commit` Phase 3 and `/flow:start` CODE step 8, through `bin/flow-classify-s1.sh` | For each file classified uncertain: does this change serve the issue's objective? (`serves_issue`, noul) | `off` | 0.6, provisional |

### classify.serves-issue

In `on` mode, each uncertain file's row in the prompt gets `serves issue: <p> (<model>)` in its Notes, where p is the model's probability that the change serves the issue (0 to 1, higher means more likely). The file stays uncertain and you still choose include or exclude. Red-flag files are never asked about or sent, and at most 8 files are asked per prompt. In `shadow` mode nothing new is shown; after you choose, your choice is recorded next to the model's answer (`current` is `include` or `exclude`). With no issue on the branch, no uncommitted change to the file, or no answer, the prompt is what it would be without System One.

What is sent for each file: the issue's number, title and body, the file's path and git status, its uncommitted diff (the whole file when it is untracked, `(binary)` for a binary file, at most the first 400 lines), and the signals that matched it. Path patterns keep files such as `.env` from being sent, but a secret written into the body of an ordinary file is in its diff, and that diff goes to the provider you configured, which for TypeSafe is off this machine.

The threshold 0.6 is provisional: it is used while shadow records are collected, and shadow records keep every answer, below the threshold or not. It is replaced, with an entry for the collecting model, from a written comparison of the shadow records with the choices made, before the site is switched on by default.

## Providers

Both providers serve the same contract, `POST <baseUrl>/v1/systemone` with `{state, questions, model}`, so one client works with either.

| | TypeSafe (Jev) | imajev |
|---|---|---|
| Where it runs | TypeSafe's hosted API, `https://api.typesafe.ai` | your machine; default `http://127.0.0.1:8765` |
| Key | required, read from `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | none |
| Model | `jev-1.13.0` by default, a pinned version | whichever model the server loaded |
| State limit | 32k tokens for the state plus the longest question | about 8k tokens (32 KB) |
| **What leaves this machine** | **everything Flow sends: diffs, review comments, transcript excerpts** | **nothing** |

Sources: [TypeSafe API](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api) and [models](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models); the imajev [README](https://github.com/mohit67890/imajev).

`custom` is any other server with the same contract, at the `baseUrl` you give.

A server on this machine is reached directly, never through `HTTP_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY`: through a proxy, the key and the state would leave the machine in plain text. A remote server is reached the way your environment's proxy settings say, over https. Whether the host is this machine is judged as urllib decodes it, since that is the host the request goes to: `[::ffff:127%2e0.0.1]` is this machine, and `[::1%3a1]` (`::1:1`) is not.

## Configure it

Put the provider in **your user settings**, `~/.claude/settings.flow.json`. Flow reads the provider, address, model and key variable from that file and from the plugin default only. A repository's `.claude/settings.flow.json` or `.claude/settings.flow.local.json` comes with the checkout. If Flow read the provider from there, a cloned repository could send your diffs, and the key in any environment variable it names, to its own server. Values set there are ignored, with a warning.

TypeSafe:

```json
{
  "systemOne": {
    "provider": "typesafe",
    "uses": { "review.dedup": "shadow" }
  }
}
```

with `export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...` in your shell. The key never goes in a settings file.

imajev, after starting its server as its README describes:

```json
{
  "systemOne": {
    "provider": "imajev",
    "timeoutMs": 20000,
    "uses": { "review.dedup": "shadow" }
  }
}
```

A local model is slower than the 3-second default allows. On an M1 Mac mini with 16 GB, imajev-4b answered three questions in about 5.8 s with the README's settings (four option orders averaged, `--rotations 4`) and in about 2.0 s with `--rotations 1`. TypeSafe answered the same three in about 1.5 s. A request that runs past `timeoutMs` gets no answer, so Flow keeps its current behavior.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `none` | `none`, `typesafe`, `imajev` or `custom` |
| `baseUrl` | the provider's | Must be `https://` unless the host is this machine (`localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, or an IPv4-mapped `::ffff:127.0.0.0/104`) |
| `model` | the provider's | Sent with each request. Keep TypeSafe on a pinned version: `jev-latest` moves between releases, and thresholds are measured per version |
| `apiKeyEnv` | the provider's | Name of the environment variable that holds the key, sent as `Authorization: Bearer` |
| `timeoutMs` | `3000` | Limit for the request, from connecting to the last byte of the reply, clamped to 200-30000. Reading and shortening the state happen before it and are not counted. A whole number of up to 9 digits (`20000.0` counts as `20000`); anything else is warned about and `3000` is used, except a value longer than 4096 characters, which is `invalid-settings` |
| `stateTokenCap` | `0` | Longest state sent, in tokens estimated as 4 characters each. `0` uses the provider's default (TypeSafe 28000, imajev and custom 7000). A whole number of up to 9 digits; anything else is warned about and the provider's default is used, except a value longer than 4096 characters, which is `invalid-settings` |
| `uses.<site>` | `off` | `off`, `shadow` or `on` per decision point. The one setting a repository may set, but not to `on`: `on` counts when your user settings or the plugin default set it. A repository that sets `on` where you did not gets your own mode for that site, with one warning. `off` and `shadow` from a repository are taken as they are, so a repository can switch a site to `shadow`, which sends the request, and so the state from your checkout, to your provider without acting on the answer |

**Working inside the Flow repository itself.** When the plugin being run sits inside the repository you are working in, as it does in synapti-marketplace, `cascade-resolve.sh --no-repo-settings` refuses to answer. Every call is then "no answer" with the reason `settings-refused`. This is deliberate: it is the same rule that keeps a pull request from supplying its own review settings. To try a provider here, run Flow from an installed copy of the plugin.

## Modes

- **off**: the decision point is not asked. Nothing is sent.
- **shadow**: the question is asked and the answers are recorded next to the decision Flow made without them. The caller still gets "no answer", so Flow's behavior does not change. Use it to collect the data a threshold is chosen from.
- **on**: Flow uses the answers when every question at the decision point answered with enough confidence.

## The rule every decision point follows

An answer may add caution: demote a finding's confidence, send a decision to the user, move a criterion from PASS to NEEDS-HUMAN-REVIEW, add a warning. It may not, by itself, drop a finding, lift a block, or move a verdict toward done. Security findings are never demoted or merged. A decision point that needs an exception, such as merging duplicate findings, is switched on by default only after a measurement shows a gain.

## Calling the client

```bash
plugins/flow/bin/flow-s1.sh ask --site review.dedup --state-file "$STATE" \
  [--state-format text|json] [--current "$TODAYS_DECISION"] [--run-id "$RUN_ID"] [--ref "$ITEM"]
```

Always call `flow-s1.sh`, never `_flow_s1.py` directly: the wrapper reads the settings from the right tiers and removes the working directory from `PYTHONPATH` before Python starts, which Python cannot do for itself.

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Answered. stdout is one JSON line: `{"site","provider","model","truncated","answers":{<question id>:{...}}}` |
| `3` | No answer. stdout is empty; stderr says `flow-s1: no answer: <reason>` on one line, sometimes followed by a detail in parentheses, whose line breaks become spaces and whose other control characters are escaped. **Do what Flow did before.** |
| `2` | Usage error: a missing or malformed argument. `--site` is lowercase words joined by dots; `--ref` starts with a letter or digit, uses only letters, digits and `.` `_` `:` `/` `#` `@` `+` `-`, and is at most 200 characters; `--run-id` starts with a letter or digit, uses only letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, and does not contain `..` |

Each answer in `answers`:

| Type | Fields |
|---|---|
| noul | `type`, `p` (probability of yes), `confidence` = \|2p − 1\| |
| choice | `type`, `choice`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| score | `type`, `score`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |

`unknown_probability` is copied when the provider sends it (imajev does); like a confidence, it must be a number from 0 to 1 or the call is `malformed`. For a choice or a score, confidence is the provider's own, and it must be a number from 0 to 1 or the call is `malformed`. When it is missing (`null` counts as missing), it is TypeSafe's documented formula: with n options and the largest probability m, it is (n·m − 1)/(n − 1). For a noul that formula is \|2p − 1\|, so p = 0.95 and p = 0.05 are equally confident.

A choice or a score must agree with itself as the [TypeSafe API](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/choice.md) defines it, or the call is `malformed`:

- `probabilities` has an entry for every option (for a score, every level, keyed `"0"`, `"1"`, ...), and they sum to 1;
- the choice is the most probable option;
- the score is each level times its probability, added up ([Score](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/score.md)).

TypeSafe sends each value rounded to two decimals, so the sum and the score allow 0.005 for every rounded value they combine: for n options the sum may be off by 0.005·n, and the score by 0.005·(1 + n(n − 1)/2). The choice gets no allowance, because rounding keeps the order of the values: the chosen option's probability must be the largest, or tied with it.

A call is all-or-nothing. If any question abstains, is missing, is malformed, or is below its threshold, the whole call is "no answer". Ask independent judgments in separate calls if one may fail without the others.

With `--state-format json` the state is sent as a JSON value, so questions can refer to its fields by name (`` `finding.location` ``). When it is over the limit, every string longer than one common length is cut to that length, the largest at which the state fits; shorter strings keep their full text. A text state is cut at the limit. Either way `truncated` is `true`.

### Reasons for "no answer"

| Reason | When |
|---|---|
| `provider-none` | No provider is configured (the default) |
| `mode-off` | The decision point is `off`, or its mode is not one of `off`, `shadow`, `on` (with a warning) |
| `shadow` | The decision point is in `shadow` mode and every question answered |
| `settings-refused` | `cascade-resolve.sh` refused to read the provider settings, for example because the plugin is inside the repository |
| `invalid-settings` | Unknown provider; a `baseUrl` that is not an http(s) URL, cannot be parsed, or holds a space, a control character, a character outside ASCII (write a host outside ASCII in its `xn--` form, since the request carries the host as written), a user (with or without a password), a query or a fragment, even an empty one (the request goes to `<baseUrl>/v1/systemone`), a port that is not 1 to 5 ASCII digits from 0 to 65535, brackets that hold anything but an IPv6 address, as written and as urllib decodes it, or a percent sign in the host or port outside an IPv6 zone id; a provider setting (`provider`, `baseUrl`, `model`, `apiKeyEnv`, `timeoutMs`, `stateTokenCap`) longer than 4096 characters; a missing `baseUrl` for `custom`; an `apiKeyEnv` that is not a variable name; a key a request header cannot carry (a line break, or a character outside Latin-1), which is never printed; or a model id that is not plain text (a control character, a lone surrogate, a line separator). A warning names the rule and never prints the baseUrl, since a URL can carry a password or a key in any part |
| `insecure-url` | A plain `http://` address for a host other than this machine |
| `no-api-key` | TypeSafe with its key variable unset or empty |
| `unknown-site` | The questions file has no entry for the site |
| `no-threshold` | A question has no threshold |
| `questions-invalid` | The questions file is not a regular file (a FIFO is not waited on), or cannot be read or parsed (any error while reading it: a byte that is not UTF-8, a merge key (`<<`), an integer of more than 4300 digits, a value YAML cannot build, nesting too deep to parse), or has the wrong shape: a question id or a threshold's model id that is not a string; instructions that are not text, an object or a list; a choice without its options, with option names that are not strings, or with an option described by something other than text, an object, a list or null; a score without 2 to 10 levels, or with a level that is not text, an object or a list; noul criteria that do not describe exactly `"true"` and `"false"`; anywhere in a question, a key that is not a string or a value JSON has no form for (a date, a set, a YAML ordered map or pairs); questions that would be more than 1 MiB when sent, escapes included (YAML aliases repeat what they name, so a short file can stand for a large body); or questions this interpreter cannot encode for the request (`.inf`, a lone surrogate, nesting deeper than its JSON encoder goes). Quote `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `~`, numbers and dates wherever text is meant |
| `python-missing` | python3 or PyYAML is not available |
| `state-invalid` | The state file cannot be opened or is not a regular file, such as a directory, a device or a FIFO, which is not waited on (flow-s1.sh passes only a readable regular file, so this is seen when the client is run directly); or `--state-format json` and the file cannot be read as JSON (not JSON, or an integer of more than 4300 digits), is nested too deeply to process, or cannot be encoded for the request (a lone surrogate, `NaN`, `Infinity`, a number too large for a float such as `1e400`). How deep is too deep depends on the interpreter and on whether the state must be shortened: Python 3.14.6 takes more than 5000 levels, or about 990 when shortening. The exact limit moves by a level with what the innermost level holds |
| `state-too-large` | A text state file larger than 64 MiB, or a JSON state file larger than 8 MiB (parsing JSON takes many times the file's size; any format other than text is read as JSON), before it is read; or a JSON state that no shortening of its strings brings under the limit |
| `timeout` | The request took longer than `timeoutMs` |
| `connection` | The server could not be reached |
| `redirect` | The server answered with a redirect. Redirects are never followed, so a key cannot be carried to another host |
| `http-<status>` | Any status other than 200, for example `http-429`, `http-500`, `http-529` |
| `malformed` | The reply is larger than 4 MiB (only that much is read), is not JSON (or holds an integer of more than 4300 digits, or is nested deeper than this interpreter's JSON parser goes), has no `answers`, an answer has the wrong type or fields, a choice is not one of the question's options, a score is outside its levels, a choice or a score contradicts its own probabilities (see above), a choice's or a score's confidence is not a number from 0 to 1 (`null` counts as absent), an `unknown_probability` is not a number from 0 to 1 (`null` counts as absent), an `abstained` is not true or false (`null` counts as absent), its model id is not a string (`null` counts as absent), or a string in it (the model id, an option name) contains a control character, a lone surrogate or a line separator. A reply with no model id is taken as answered by the configured model |
| `missing-answer` | The reply has no answer for a question |
| `abstained` | The provider declined to answer a question (imajev's `abstained: true`) |
| `below-threshold` | An answer's confidence is below the question's threshold |
| `internal-error` | A defect in the client's own code, including its checks of the settings and the questions once they are read; stderr names the error type. No traceback is printed. Writing records never causes it: a failure there is a warning, and the call's answer or reason stands |

## Questions and thresholds

Every question Flow asks, and the confidence each answer needs, is in [`system-one/questions.yaml`](../system-one/questions.yaml), so a reviewer can read all of them in one place. It ships with no sites. An entry looks like this:

```yaml
sites:
  review.dedup:
    questions:
      same_defect:
        type: choice
        instructions: "Which consolidated finding reports the same defect as `new`?"
        criteria: {F1: null, F2: null, none: "no consolidated finding reports it"}
    thresholds:
      same_defect:
        default: 0.8
        models: {jev-1.13.0: 0.75}
```

`questions` is sent to the provider as YAML reads it, in the shapes TypeSafe's API documents: instructions are text, an object or a list; a choice maps each option to a description (text, an object, a list or null); a score lists 2 to 10 levels (each text, an object or a list); a noul's optional criteria describe `"true"` and `"false"`. YAML reads unquoted `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `~`, numbers and dates as other types, so Flow refuses the file (`questions-invalid`) where one of these fields, an id or an option name would not be sent as written, or where a value cannot be sent as JSON. Inside an object or a list, values are sent as YAML reads them. The question id is not sent to the model, so the instructions must carry the whole meaning. A threshold is looked up by the model id the reply names, then `default`. A threshold is set from measurements on that model version, and a new version needs its own measurement before its entry is added.

## Records

In `shadow` and `on` mode, every request writes one JSON line per question:

```json
{"ts": "...", "site": "review.dedup", "question": "same_defect", "mode": "shadow",
 "provider": "typesafe", "model": "jev-1.13.0", "result": "answered",
 "answer": {...}, "current": "keep-separate", "ref": "pr:275/inline:12345",
 "state_sha256": "..."}
```

`result` is `answered` or the reason the question failed. `current` is the decision Flow made without System One, passed with `--current`. `ref` names the item the questions were about, passed with `--ref` (null without it), so a shadow record can be matched to that item when shadow records are compared with the decisions taken; it is never sent to the provider. The state itself is never recorded; its sha256 identifies it.

Records go to `.flow/runs/<run-id>/system-one.jsonl` when `--run-id` names an existing run. Otherwise they go to `system-one.jsonl` in the per-user state directory (`~/.claude/flow-state`, or a `FLOW_STATE_DIR` you set; one the repository chose is ignored, see [README: Per-user locations](../README.md#per-user-locations)). Nothing is written through a symlink or to anything but a regular file, and no run directory is created. A record that cannot be written, including one whose lock another process holds for more than a second, is a warning and does not change the answer.
