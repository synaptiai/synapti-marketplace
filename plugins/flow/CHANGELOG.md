# Changelog

## 2.0.0 (2026-04-16)

### Breaking Changes

- `tddMode` default changed from `suggest` to `enforce`
- `verdict.requireAllPass` default changed from `false` to `true`
- P3 findings are no longer deferrable -- fix in-PR or file a Proactive-Autonomy escalation
- Pre-existing findings in touched files keep natural priority (no longer capped at P3)
- Merge gate now blocks on unresolved findings in FLOW_RESOLUTION_CYCLE markers
- "DEFERRED" markers renamed to "ESCALATED" in FLOW_RESOLUTION_CYCLE comments

### New Features

- Spec Validation Gate: acceptance criteria must have concrete automated verification commands before PLAN phase
- Specification capture: non-goals, failure modes, and interface contracts required in EXPLORE phase
- Stranger Test: mandatory end-of-PLAN gate ensuring zero-context executability
- Per-task verification gate: tests must pass and evidence captured before TaskUpdate(completed)
- Holdout-validation skill: cross-references agent self-review claims against actual file state
- Evidence bundle completeness: "What was NOT tested", "Known limitations", "Negative/adversarial cases" required per criterion
- Missing-criterion scan: verdict-judge Step 1 checks every criterion has evidence before evaluation
- Proactive Autonomy with Prepared Escalation: codified six-field structure, anti-pattern list
- Finding-ledger merge gate: blocks merge on non-empty ESCALATED array

### Migration Guide

- To keep old TDD behavior: set `testing.tddMode: "suggest"` and `testing.tddModeOptOut: true` in settings.json
- To keep old verdict behavior: set `verdict.requireAllPass: false` in settings.json
- "DEFERRED" markers renamed to "ESCALATED" in FLOW_RESOLUTION_CYCLE comments
