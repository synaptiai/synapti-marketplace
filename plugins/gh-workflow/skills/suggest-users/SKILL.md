# Suggest Users

This skill provides intelligent user suggestions for PRs (reviewers) and issues (assignees) based on GitHub repository data, file ownership, and activity patterns.

## Purpose

Instead of manually picking reviewers or assignees, this skill analyzes:
- CODEOWNERS file for explicit ownership
- Recent PR activity for active contributors
- File-specific commit history for expertise
- Current review load to balance workload

## Quick Reference

### Get Suggested Reviewers for a PR

```bash
# 1. Get repository info
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')

# 2. Get changed files in PR
CHANGED_FILES=$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json files --jq '.files[].path')

# 3. Check CODEOWNERS matches
gh api repos/$REPO/contents/.github/CODEOWNERS --jq '.content' | base64 -d 2>/dev/null

# 4. Get collaborators with push access
gh api repos/$REPO/collaborators --jq '.[] | select(.permissions.push) | .login'

# 5. Get recent PR authors/reviewers
gh pr list --state merged --limit 20 --json author,reviews --jq '.[].author.login, .[].reviews[].author.login' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# 6. Get file-specific contributors (last 30 days)
git log --format='%an' --since="30 days ago" -- {changed_files} | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Get Suggested Assignees for an Issue

```bash
# 1. Get repository info
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')

# 2. Get collaborators
gh api repos/$REPO/collaborators --jq '.[] | select(.permissions.push) | .login'

# 3. Get recent issue assignees by label
gh issue list --state closed --limit 20 --label "{label}" --json assignees --jq '.[].assignees[].login' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# 4. Get team members if applicable
gh api repos/$REPO/teams --jq '.[].slug' 2>/dev/null
```

## Scoring Algorithm

### For Reviewers (PR Context)

| Signal | Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| CODEOWNERS match | +50 | Explicit ownership declaration |
| Commits to changed files (last 30d) | +10 per match | File-level expertise |
| Recent PR reviews | +5 per review (max 25) | Active reviewer |
| Recent PR authorship | +3 per PR (max 15) | Active contributor |
| Same team membership | +10 | Team context |
| Open review load | -3 per open review | Workload balancing |
| Is PR author | -100 | Cannot self-review |

### For Assignees (Issue Context)

| Signal | Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Recent issues with same label | +10 per issue | Domain expertise |
| Recent commits to related files | +5 per commit | Code familiarity |
| Current open issue count | -2 per issue | Workload balancing |
| Explicit @mention in issue | +20 | Stakeholder indication |

## Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Data (Parallel)

Execute these commands in parallel to collect all signals:

```bash
# Repository info
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')

# Collaborators
gh api repos/$REPO/collaborators --jq '.[] | select(.permissions.push) | {login: .login, admin: .permissions.admin}'

# CODEOWNERS (may not exist)
gh api repos/$REPO/contents/.github/CODEOWNERS --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null | base64 -d

# Alternative CODEOWNERS location
gh api repos/$REPO/contents/CODEOWNERS --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null | base64 -d

# Recent merged PRs with authors and reviewers
gh pr list --state merged --limit 30 --json number,author,reviews,mergedAt --jq '.[] | {author: .author.login, reviewers: [.reviews[].author.login]}'

# Open PRs with pending reviews (for workload)
gh pr list --state open --json number,reviews --jq '.[] | {number, pending_reviewers: [.reviews[] | select(.state == "PENDING") | .author.login]}'
```

### Step 2: Match CODEOWNERS

Parse CODEOWNERS file and match against changed files:

```
# CODEOWNERS format examples:
# * @default-owner
# /src/api/ @api-team
# *.ts @typescript-owners

# Match rules:
# 1. More specific paths take precedence
# 2. Multiple owners can be specified per pattern
# 3. Teams use @org/team-name format
```

### Step 3: Calculate Scores

For each potential reviewer/assignee:

```markdown
## Scoring: {username}

| Signal | Value | Points |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CODEOWNERS match | Yes/No | +50/0 |
| File commits (30d) | {N} files | +{N*10} |
| Recent reviews | {M} PRs | +{min(M*5, 25)} |
| Open reviews | {K} PRs | -{K*3} |
| **Total** | | **{sum}** |
```

### Step 4: Present Suggestions

Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** with ranked options:

```markdown
## Suggested Reviewers

Based on file ownership, recent activity, and current workload:

| Rank | User | Score | Reasons |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | @alice | 75 | CODEOWNERS (+50), 2 file commits (+20), low workload (+5) |
| 2 | @bob | 45 | 4 recent reviews (+20), 2 file commits (+20), 1 open review (-3) |
| 3 | @carol | 30 | 3 file commits (+30), no ownership |
```

Then invoke AskUserQuestion:
- **Option 1**: "@alice (Recommended)" - Top ranked reviewer
- **Option 2**: "@bob" - Active reviewer
- **Option 3**: "@carol" - File expertise
- **Option 4**: "Someone else" - Manual selection

## Integration Points

### In gh-pr Command

```markdown
## Phase 5: Reviewer Suggestion

1. Invoke suggest-users skill
2. Get changed files from staged commits
3. Calculate scores for all collaborators
4. Present top 3-4 suggestions with AskUserQuestion
5. Add selected reviewers to PR creation command
```

### In gh-address Command

```markdown
## Reviewer Re-engagement

1. Fetch previous reviewers from PR
2. Score based on: previous review (+30), comment count (+5 per)
3. Suggest re-requesting review from engaged reviewers
```

### In gh-review Command

```markdown
## Alternative Reviewer Suggestion

If current reviewer wants to defer:
1. Calculate scores excluding current reviewer
2. Suggest alternatives with expertise in PR's changed files
```

### In gh-issue Command

```markdown
## Assignee Suggestion

1. Parse issue labels and title
2. Find users with history on similar issues
3. Present suggestions with AskUserQuestion
```

## CODEOWNERS Parsing

### Pattern Matching Rules

```bash
# Pattern precedence (later = higher priority)
*                    # Default owners for everything
*.js                 # All JavaScript files
/docs/               # /docs/ directory at root
docs/                # docs/ directory anywhere
/src/api/**/*.ts     # TypeScript files in src/api/

# Multiple owners
/src/core/ @alice @bob @org/core-team

# Escaping special characters
/path/with\ space/   # Space in path
```

### Team Resolution

When CODEOWNERS specifies a team (`@org/team-name`):

```bash
# Resolve team members
gh api orgs/{org}/teams/{team-name}/members --jq '.[].login'
```

## Workload Balancing

To prevent overloading active reviewers:

```bash
# Count open reviews per user
gh pr list --state open --json reviews --jq '
  [.[].reviews[] | select(.state == "PENDING" or .state == "COMMENTED") | .author.login]
  | group_by(.)
  | map({user: .[0], count: length})
  | sort_by(-.count)
'
```

Apply penalty: `-3 points per open review`

## Edge Cases

### No CODEOWNERS File

Fall back to:
1. Recent file contributors
2. Recent PR reviewers
3. All collaborators (alphabetical)

### No Recent Activity

If no commits or PRs in last 30 days:
1. Extend window to 90 days
2. Fall back to all collaborators

### Private Repository / API Limits

If API calls fail:
1. Use git log for local contributor data
2. Present collaborator list from gh api
3. Allow manual input

### Single Contributor Repository

Skip suggestion and note:
```markdown
**Note**: Single contributor detected. Self-review checklist recommended instead of external reviewer.
```

## Output Format

When invoked by other commands, return structured data:

```markdown
## User Suggestions

**Context**: {PR/Issue} #{number}
**Changed Files**: {count} files
**CODEOWNERS Matches**: {yes/no}

### Ranked Suggestions

1. **@{user1}** (Score: {N})
   - {reason1}
   - {reason2}

2. **@{user2}** (Score: {M})
   - {reason1}

3. **@{user3}** (Score: {K})
   - {reason1}

### Recommendation

Based on scoring, **@{user1}** is the recommended {reviewer/assignee} because:
- {primary reason}
- {secondary reason}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always check CODEOWNERS first** - Explicit ownership trumps heuristics
2. **Balance workload** - Don't always suggest the most active reviewer
3. **Show reasoning** - Users should understand why suggestions were made
4. **Allow override** - Always provide "Someone else" option
5. **Cache results** - Don't re-fetch data within same session
6. **Handle failures gracefully** - API errors shouldn't block workflow
