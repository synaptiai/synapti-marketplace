# Runtime Verification

This skill verifies that an implementation actually works at runtime, not just that it compiles and passes lint/tests.

## Purpose

Quality checks (lint, test, typecheck) answer "does it compile?" This skill answers "does it work?" by:
- Starting dev servers and verifying they respond
- Running smoke tests against new/modified endpoints
- Executing E2E test suites if available
- Visually verifying UI changes in the browser
- Verifying acceptance criteria programmatically

## Quick Verification Fast Path

Before running the full discovery process, check for an existing verification script. Many mature projects already wire everything up in one command — if one exists, run it and skip the rest.

```bash
# Check for dedicated verification scripts
ls verify.sh test-e2e.sh smoke-test.sh scripts/verify* 2>/dev/null

# Check Makefile for verify/e2e/smoke targets
grep -E "^(verify|e2e|smoke|integration-test):" Makefile 2>/dev/null
```

If found, run it with a timeout:
```bash
timeout 180 ./verify.sh 2>&1  # or make verify, etc.
```

If it passes, skip to Output Format. If it fails or no script exists, continue with full discovery.

## Discovery Process

### Step 1: Check CLAUDE.md for Dev/Test Commands

Search project instructions for any development or verification commands:

```bash
grep -iE "(dev server|npm run|yarn |pnpm |python.*run|go run|cargo run|docker.compose|make\s+\w+|uvicorn|gunicorn|flask run)" .claude/CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
grep -iE "(verify|e2e|smoke|integration|acceptance)" .claude/CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Check for E2E Test Frameworks

```bash
# Playwright
ls playwright.config.* 2>/dev/null
grep -l "playwright" package.json 2>/dev/null

# Cypress
ls cypress.config.* cypress/ 2>/dev/null

# Selenium
grep -l "selenium" requirements.txt pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Discover Dev Server Commands

```bash
# Node.js
grep -E '"(dev|start|serve)"' package.json 2>/dev/null

# Makefile
grep -E "^(dev|serve|run|start|up):" Makefile 2>/dev/null

# Docker
ls docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yaml compose.yml compose.yaml 2>/dev/null

# Python
ls manage.py 2>/dev/null && echo "django: python manage.py runserver"
grep -E "(uvicorn|gunicorn|flask)" pyproject.toml requirements.txt 2>/dev/null

# Go
ls main.go cmd/*/main.go 2>/dev/null && echo "go: go run ."

# Monorepo
ls turbo.json 2>/dev/null && echo "turbo: check turbo.json for dev pipeline"
```

### Step 4: Discover Port Configuration

```bash
# Check for port configuration
grep -rE "PORT|:3000|:8080|:5173|:4000|:8000|:3001" package.json .env .env.local .env.development 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Common framework defaults:
# Vite/SvelteKit=5173, Next.js/Rails=3000, CRA=3000
# Django=8000, Flask=5000, Go=8080, Spring=8080
```

### Step 5: Check for Health/Readiness Endpoints

```bash
grep -rn "health\|healthz\|ready\|alive\|ping" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.go" --include="*.java" . 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

## Runtime Verification Protocol

### Step 1: Service Startup (if applicable)

If a dev server command is discovered:

1. Start server in background with PID tracking:
   ```bash
   {dev_cmd} &
   DEV_PID=$!
   ```

2. Wait for ready signal — try common health paths, fall back to port check:
   ```bash
   PORT={detected_port:-3000}
   for i in {1..30}; do
     curl -sf http://localhost:$PORT/ > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
     curl -sf http://localhost:$PORT/health > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
     curl -sf http://localhost:$PORT/healthz > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
     curl -sf http://localhost:$PORT/api/health > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
     nc -z localhost $PORT 2>/dev/null && break
     sleep 1
   done
   ```

3. If server doesn't start within 30s, report as verification failure with the last few lines of output

### Step 2: Smoke Tests

For each new/modified API endpoint in the diff:

**Detecting endpoints from the diff:**
```bash
# Find route definitions in changed files
git diff origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH..HEAD --name-only | xargs grep -nE \
  "@(app|router)\.(get|post|put|patch|delete)|app\.(get|post|put|use)|router\.(get|post)|@(Get|Post|Put|Delete|Patch)Mapping|@api_view|path\(" \
  2>/dev/null
```

For each discovered endpoint:
1. Send a basic request and verify non-error response
2. Verify response structure matches expected schema
3. Test with invalid input and verify error handling

### Step 3: E2E Tests (if framework detected)

Run discovered E2E test command with a timeout to prevent hanging:
```bash
timeout 120 npx playwright test 2>&1  # or
timeout 120 npx cypress run 2>&1       # or
timeout 120 pytest tests/e2e/ 2>&1     # etc.
```

If the full suite is too large, run only tests related to changed files:
```bash
# Playwright: run specific test file
timeout 120 npx playwright test tests/e2e/changed-feature.spec.ts 2>&1

# Pytest: run tests matching changed module names
timeout 120 pytest tests/e2e/ -k "changed_module" 2>&1
```

### Step 4: Visual Verification (if UI changes detected)

When the diff includes frontend changes (templates, components, styles, layouts), visually verify the running application in a browser. This catches rendering issues, broken layouts, and visual regressions that automated tests often miss.

**Detecting UI changes in the diff:**
```bash
git diff origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH..HEAD --name-only | grep -iE "\.(tsx|jsx|vue|svelte|html|css|scss|sass|less|ejs|hbs|pug)$"
```

If UI files changed and the dev server is running:

#### Option A: Browser tool (preferred)

If a browser MCP tool is available (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright MCP), use it to:

1. Navigate to the affected pages/routes
2. Take screenshots for evidence
3. Check for console errors
4. Verify interactive elements respond to clicks

```
Navigate to http://localhost:{PORT}{route}
Take a screenshot
Check the browser console for errors
```

#### Option B: Playwright screenshot script

If no browser MCP but Playwright is installed, take automated screenshots:

```bash
# Quick screenshot of affected pages
npx playwright test --project=chromium -g "screenshot" 2>&1 || \
npx playwright screenshot http://localhost:$PORT{route} screenshot-{route-name}.png 2>&1
```

#### Option C: WebFetch + curl fallback

If no browser automation is available, fetch the page HTML and verify structure:

```bash
# Fetch rendered HTML and check for expected elements
curl -s http://localhost:$PORT{route} | grep -E "<(main|section|div|h1)" | head -20
```

Use the **WebFetch tool** for richer inspection — it renders JavaScript and returns the page content, which is useful for SPAs where curl only sees a shell `<div id="root">`.

#### What to verify visually

| Check | How | Evidence |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Page loads without errors | Browser console or curl status | Screenshot or 200 OK |
| Layout isn't broken | Screenshot or HTML structure check | Screenshot file path |
| New UI elements are present | Look for expected elements in DOM | Element found / not found |
| No console errors or warnings | Browser console output | Clean console or error list |
| Interactive elements work | Click/interact via browser tool | Before/after screenshots |

Record results in the Visual Verification section of the output.

### Step 5: Acceptance Criteria Verification

For each acceptance criterion from the linked issue:
1. Identify how to verify it (API call, UI check, CLI command)
2. Execute the verification
3. Record pass/fail with evidence

### Step 6: Cleanup

Kill any background services started in Step 1:
```bash
kill $DEV_PID 2>/dev/null
# For Docker Compose
docker compose down 2>/dev/null
```

## Runtime Verification Results

### Service Status
| Service | Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Dev server | npm run dev | Started on :3000 | Healthy after 3s |

### Smoke Tests
| Endpoint/Feature | Test | Status | Evidence |
|-----------------|------|--------|----------|
| POST /api/users | Create user with valid data | Pass | 201 Created |
| POST /api/users | Create user with invalid email | Pass | 400 Bad Request |

### E2E Tests
| Suite | Status | Passed | Failed |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Playwright | Pass | 12 | 0 |

### Visual Verification
| Page/Route | Check | Status | Evidence |
|------------|-------|--------|----------|
| /dashboard | Page loads | Pass | Screenshot: screenshot-dashboard.png |
| /dashboard | No console errors | Pass | Clean console |
| /users/new | Form renders correctly | Pass | All fields present |

### Acceptance Criteria
| Criterion | Verification Method | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Users can filter by date | GET /api/users?date=2024-01-01 | Pass | Returns filtered results |

### Not Verified (Requires Manual Check)
| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Visual styling matches mockup | No browser automation available |
```

## Graceful Degradation

| Missing Capability | Fallback |
|-------------------|----------|
| No dev server command | Skip service startup, run only static checks |
| No E2E framework | Skip E2E, note as unverified |
| No health endpoint | Poll port availability with `nc -z` instead |
| No verification commands in CLAUDE.md | Infer from tech stack, ask user if ambiguous |
| Server won't start | Report failure with logs, don't block workflow |
| E2E tests timeout | Report timeout, suggest running a subset |
| No browser tool | Use Playwright screenshots, then WebFetch, then curl HTML check |
| No UI changes in diff | Skip visual verification entirely |

## Integration Points

This skill is invoked by:
- `gh-start` — Phase 7 (after quality checks, before code review)
- `gh-pr` — Step 3.6 (pre-PR runtime verification)

**IMPORTANT**: Runtime verification is additive, not blocking. If a project has no dev server or E2E framework, this skill completes with "skipped" status and the workflow continues.
