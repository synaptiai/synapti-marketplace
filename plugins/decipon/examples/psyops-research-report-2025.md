# The Current State of Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Techniques
## A Deep Research Report — December 19, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Psychological operations have evolved from loudspeakers and pamphlets into AI-augmented, multi-domain cognitive warfare. NATO now formally recognizes cognitive warfare as a "potential sixth warfighting domain," and has established the Applied Cognitive Effects (ACE) function in 2025 to implement its doctrine. The defining principle: **the human brain is both the target and the weapon**.

The threat landscape in 2025 is characterized by exponential growth in synthetic media. Deepfake incidents reached 487 in Q2 2025 (up 312% year-over-year), with financial losses exceeding $347 million in Q2 alone. Europol projects that **90% of online content may be synthetically generated by 2026**. Bot traffic now comprises 51% of all web traffic—surpassing human activity for the first time in a decade.

Critically, **all major powers conduct influence operations**. While Russia, China, and Iran are most frequently cited as adversaries, the U.S. Pentagon was exposed in 2022 for operating fake social media accounts (leading to an audit), and is currently seeking AI technology to create "convincing online personas." Israel announced a 20-fold increase in "hasbara" (public diplomacy) spending to $150 million in 2025, including $6 million specifically to influence how AI chatbots respond to Israel-related queries.

Countermeasures remain challenging. Human detection of deepfakes hovers at 24.5% for video, and experts warn that visual/audio detection "tells" will disappear within 6-12 months as technology improves. Psychological inoculation ("prebunking") shows promise but carries the risk of increasing skepticism toward true information. The new TAKE IT DOWN Act (May 2025) represents the first major U.S. federal legislation specifically targeting synthetic media.

## 1. Definitional Framework

### 1.1 U.S. Military Terminology (December 2025)

On December 2, 2025, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signed a memorandum reverting "Military Information Support Operations" (MISO) back to **"Psychological Operations" (PSYOP)**.

> "With fifteen years of additional perspective, it has become clear that the term PSYOP more closely aligns functions with branding, eliminates confusion, and directly supports my priorities to reestablish deterrence and revive the warrior ethos."

Full implementation expected by end of FY2026.

**Three PSYOP levels:**
| Level | Scope | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Strategic | Government-wide | Long-term national objectives |
| Operational | Theater-level | Joint force effectiveness |
| Tactical | Local commander | Immediate battlefield advantage |

**Product attribution:**
- **White**: Openly attributed to source
- **Gray**: Source deliberately obscured
- **Black**: Attributed to false source

### 1.2 NATO Cognitive Warfare Doctrine (2025)

NATO Allied Command Transformation defines cognitive warfare as:

> "Activities conducted in synchronization with other Instruments of Power, to affect attitudes and behavior by influencing, protecting, or disrupting individual and group cognition to gain advantage over an adversary."

**2025 Implementation:**
- **Applied Cognitive Effects (ACE)** function established at HQ SACT
- Team comprises experts in Behavioral Science, Psychology, Information Operations, PSYOP, Tactical Deception, Wargaming, Red Teaming
- Focus areas: Doctrine integration, education/training, exercises, wargaming, future strategy, and **Agentic Warfare**
- AI governance standards development for trustworthy, transparent AI systems

Key doctrine: **"Cognitive warfare is not the means by which we fight; it is the fight itself."**

### 1.3 China's Cognitive Warfare Doctrine

**"Three Warfares" (三战)** - PLA doctrine since 2003:
1. **Public Opinion/Media Warfare**: Control of communications channels
2. **Psychological Warfare**: Disrupting adversary decision-making
3. **Legal Warfare (Lawfare)**: Using law to claim legitimacy

**April 2024 restructuring:**
- **Information Support Force (ISF)** established—President Xi personally presented the flag
- Alongside Aerospace Support Force and Cyberspace Force
- ISF uniquely received Xi's personal flag presentation

**Emerging capabilities:**
- Building dossiers on U.S. citizens using stolen data correlated with AI
- "Intelligent Psychological Monitoring System" using biometric bracelets
- Generative AI for both overt propaganda and covert PSYOP
- Brain-computer interfaces for decision-making optimization

### 1.4 Emerging Discipline: Cognitive Intelligence (COGINT)

A 2025 peer-reviewed article identifies **Cognitive Intelligence (COGINT)** as the next evolution in intelligence collection disciplines:

> "The systematic mapping, safeguarding, and operational exploitation of decision-making architectures in contemporary cognitive battlespace."

## 6. Detection & Countermeasures (2025)

### 6.1 Technical Detection

**Current state:**
- GAN-based detection achieving 95%+ accuracy in controlled conditions
- Zero-shot detection methods emerging (model fingerprinting, watermarking)
- Gaze tracking during video calls for deepfake detection

**Market leader:** Reality Defender named by Gartner as "Company to Beat" using ensemble-of-models approach.

**Critical limitations:**
- Lab-to-real-world accuracy drop: 45-50%
- Under adversarial attack: Accuracy can drop to 0.08%
- Expert warning: Detection "tells" disappearing within 6-12 months

### 6.2 Psychological Inoculation ("Prebunking")

**Evidence (2025 research):**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Prebunking more durable than debunking for election misinformation | Science Advances |
| Most effective among those predisposed to believe false claims | Science Advances |
| Debunking slightly more effective per-instance | EU JRC |
| Effects persist ~1 month | HKS Misinformation Review |
| Logic-based inoculation reduces conspiracy beliefs | ScienceDirect |

**Limitation:** Can increase skepticism toward TRUE information.

**Best practice:** Combined approach (inoculation + accuracy prompts) most effective.

### 6.3 Regulatory Landscape (2025)

**United States:**
- **TAKE IT DOWN Act** (May 2025): Requires removal of non-consensual intimate content
- FCC proposed rule: Disclosure for AI in political ads
- State-level bot disclosure laws (California, others)

Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea demonstrate "operational alignment":
- Shared malware and exploit kits
- Coordinated disinformation campaigns
- Joint military exercises
- December 2025: 10th China-Russia joint strategic air patrol
- January 2025: Iran-Russia 20-year strategic partnership treaty

**U.S. Intelligence Assessment (2025):** These nations are "launching operations increasingly cooperating with one another, enhancing the threat they pose."

### 7.2 Information Confrontation Spending

| Actor | Annual Spending |
|-------|-----------------|
| Russia (RT alone) | $300+ million |
| Russia (total international information) | ~$1.5 billion |
| Israel (2025 hasbara) | $150 million |
| Israel (2026 planned) | $729 million |

---

## 8. Assessment & Outlook

### 8.1 Effectiveness Paradox

Despite massive investment and sophisticated operations:
- **2024 U.S. elections**: No conclusive evidence influence operations changed outcomes
- **Israel hasbara**: "Nearly zero results" after decade of multimillion-dollar campaigns
- Operations demonstrably amplify polarization and erode trust, but rarely change minds

**Key insight:** Operations most effective at reinforcing existing beliefs rather than changing them.

### 8.2 Critical Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Impact |
|---------------|--------|
| Platform moderation rollback | Reduced defenses against manipulation |
| AI detection lag | Generation technology outpacing detection |
| Human detection failure | 24.5% accuracy worse than coin flip |
| Scale asymmetry | Synthetic content production unlimited; fact-checking finite |

### 8.3 U.S. Strategic Gap

White paper finding: The United States is **"outspent, out-gunned and out-maneuvered"** in cognitive and information warfare to foreign-facing audiences.

### 8.4 Future Projections

- **Near-term (6-12 months)**: Visual/audio deepfake detection "tells" will disappear
- **2026**: 90% of online content may be synthetically generated (Europol)
- **2027**: AI-facilitated fraud projected at $40 billion (Deloitte)
- **Market growth**: Generative AI market projected 560% growth 2025-2031, reaching $442 billion
